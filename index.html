                tell me something girl
                are you happy in this modern world?
                or do you need more?
                is there something else you’re searching for?

                I’m falling
                in all good times I find myself longin’ for a change
                and in the bad times I fear myself

                tell me something boy
                aren’t you tired trying to fill that void?
                or do you need more
                ain’t if hard keeping it so hardcore?

                I’m falling
                in all good times I find myself longin’ for a change
                and in the bad times I fear myself

                I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
                I'll never meet the ground
                crash through the surface
                where they can’t hurt us
                we’re from the shallow now

                in the shallow, shallow
                in the shallow, shallow
                in the shallow, shallow
                we’re from the shallow now

                I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
                I'll never meet the ground
                crash through the surface
                where they can’t hurt us
                we’re from the shallow now

                in the shallow, shallow
                in the shallow, shallow
                in the shallow, shallow
                we’re from the shallow now
